## Task Details


**Impact:** Note styles (19% of corpus)
**Effort:** 2-3 weeks

**Goal:** From GitHub Issue #88: Ensure the processor supports automatic foot/endnoting of citations to enable seamless style switching between in-text and note styles.

**Requirements:**
- Citations in manually-placed foot/endnotes (position doesn't change with style)
- Automatically created footnotes (tool creates/removes notes based on style)
- Corner cases around surrounding punctuation (footnote mark outside period at end of sentence)
- Must work in both batch (Pandoc) and interactive (Word/Zotero) workflows

**Reference implementations:**
- Zotero/citeproc-js (details unclear)
- org-cite oc-csl.el (see GitHub link in issue)

**Refs:** csln#88, GitHub #88
