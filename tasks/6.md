## Task Details


**Impact:** Multilingual bibliographies
**Effort:** 1-2 weeks

**Problem:** From GitHub Issue #97 [Expert]: In current CSL it's impossible to apply different rules for e.g. title-casing to the title of an article and the book title. However, it's quite common for edited volumes in German to contain an article in English.

**Requirements:**
- Entry-level language field support (biblatex/CSL-M pattern)
- Language-specific formatting rules per field
- Locale-specific template sections (CSL-M pattern)
- Support for multilingual documents with field-level language tagging

**Refs:** csln#66, GitHub #97
