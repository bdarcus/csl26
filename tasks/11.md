## Task Details


**Impact:** Chicago Author-Date and similar styles
**Effort:** 1-2 days

**Problem:** Chicago Author-Date shows entries out of order for anonymous works.

**Issues:**
- Anonymous work sorting not respecting "The" article stripping
- Year fallback not working correctly for same-author entries

**Fix:**
- Review anonymous work sorting logic
- Ensure article stripping ("The", "A", "An") works for all styles
- Verify year-based secondary sort for same-name entries
- Test against Chicago Author-Date

**Target:** Chicago bibliography improves from 4/15 to 5/15+

**Refs:** TIER2_PLAN.md Phase 5
