No code changes were made. The problem statement "What sort of things can I optimally use you for?" is a question about AI agent capabilities, not a technical issue requiring repository changes.

To address this as a documentation update, I would need clarification on whether you want:
- A new `docs/AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md` explaining optimal use cases
- Updates to the Contributing section in README.md
- A `.agent/CAPABILITIES.md` reference document

No pull request is needed at this time.
