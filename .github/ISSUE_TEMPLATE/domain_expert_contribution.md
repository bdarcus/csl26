## 🧐 Domain Context
*Describe the citation formatting requirement, the specific gap in current systems, or a pain point you've encountered. Be as specific as possible about the "What" and "Why".*

## 📚 Reference Materials
*Please provide links or attachments to official style guides, manuals, or specific sections that define the rules for this requirement.*
> **Note for Agents**: prefer direct links to PDF or HTML pages over general search terms.

## 📄 Real-World Examples
*Provide examples of how this should look in a bibliography or citation. "Before" and "After" comparisons are extremely helpful.*

## 🔒 Constraints (Optional)
*Are there specific rules that must NOT be broken? (e.g., "Never use italics in this specific jurisdiction").*

## 💡 Implementation Notes (Optional)
*If you have thoughts on how this should be modeled in YAML/CSLN, please share them here. No coding required!*
