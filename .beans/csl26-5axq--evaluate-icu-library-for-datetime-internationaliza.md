From GitHub Issue #93: Add proper internationalization of dates and times. Evaluate pros and cons of using ICU library vs alternatives.

Consider:
- EDTF native date handling (already prioritized)
- Locale-specific date formatting
- Integration complexity and dependencies
- Performance implications
- Compatibility with existing date handling

Impact: Architecture decision
Effort: 1 week (research + doc)
