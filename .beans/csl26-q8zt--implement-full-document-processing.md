Once migration fidelity is better, implement formatting of full documents.

Requirements:
- Support for processing complete documents (not just individual citations/bibliography)
- Integration with document formats (likely Djot integration per csln#86)
- Proper handling of citation context within paragraphs
- Output formatting for different document types

Impact: Core functionality for end users
Effort: 2-4 weeks
